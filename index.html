<p>This is a simulation of 2D particles in a plane. It has the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Collision detection between spheres</li>
<li>Gravitation between the particles</li>
<li>Ability to change physical parameters like gravity strength and the restitution of collisions</li>
<li>Ability to create particles of different masses and sizes</li>
<li>Freezing of time</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>To create a ball, press the left mouse button where you want to create it, and drag the mouse to define its velocity.</li>
<li>Right click and drag to move the view, and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.</li>
<li>Click the 'Lock Camera' button to be able to select a ball to lock the view onto.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Some examples</h3>
<h4>Gases</h4>
<p>An ideal gas can be simulated by turning on the walls. Since the Kinetic theory of Gases models them as a collection of particles which only interact with each other through elastic collisions, Newton's Laws are sufficient to simulate ideal gases. </p>

<h4>Multiple body systems</h4>
<p>By turning off the walls, a simulation of many large bodies can be created. It is possible to make systems having planets with their own moons by careful placement of particles.</p>
