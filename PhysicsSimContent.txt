### Welcome to PhysicsSim
This is a simulation of 2D particles in a plane. It has the following features:
* Gravitation between the particles
* Ability to change physical parameters like gravity strength and the restitution of collisions
* Ability to create particles of different masses and sizes
* Freezing of time
The particles follow Newton's Laws of Motion and Gravitation. They can also be used to simulate both  
an ideal gas and a real gas. Walls can be toggled on and off to simulate a closed container filled with a gas.
With the walls turned off, gravitating systems of planets can be simulated. Solar systems with planets with their   
own moons can be created if care is taken while creating the particles. States can be saved and loaded as well.
