{"name":"PhysicsSim","tagline":"A 2D Physics Simulation","body":"### Welcome to PhysicsSim\r\nThis is a simulation of 2D particles in a plane. It has the following features:\r\n* Gravitation between the particles\r\n* Ability to change physical parameters like gravity strength and the restitution of collisions\r\n* Ability to create particles of different masses and sizes\r\n* Freezing of time\r\nThe particles follow Newton's Laws of Motion and Gravitation. They can also be used to simulate both  \r\nan ideal gas and a real gas. Walls can be toggled on and off to simulate a closed container filled with a gas.\r\nWith the walls turned off, gravitating systems of planets can be simulated. Solar systems with planets with their   \r\nown moons can be created if care is taken while creating the particles. States can be saved and loaded as well.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
